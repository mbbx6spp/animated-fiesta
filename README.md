# Gilded Rose

I took [@onethirtyfive](https://github.com/onethirtyfive/gildedrosekata)'s
ending Ruby implementation of the Gilded Rose Refactoring kata and did a
super _dumb_ port, only added types where it made sense (nothing else).

Next steps will be to utilize more generic functions and further remove
complexity from the code, add more type constraints to enforce constraints
where useful, and clean up code.
